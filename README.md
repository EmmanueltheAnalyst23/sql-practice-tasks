# SQL Practice Tasks (University Coursework)

This repository contains my personal solutions to SQL tasks 75 to 118, completed as part of my Introduction to Databases course. The goal was to practice and apply SQL concepts like joins, filtering, grouping, and subqueries using real-world-style datasets such as AdventureWorks.

## What's Inside

- `.sql` files with individual queries for each task
- Screenshots of results and database diagrams
- A Tableau workbook and chart for visual analysis
- Practice with AdventureWorksLT2022 database

## Topics Covered

- SELECT statements and filtering
- JOINs and relationships between tables
- GROUP BY and aggregation
- Subqueries and calculated fields
- Visual summaries using Tableau

## Why This Matters

These tasks helped me build a strong SQL foundation and get used to solving real-world business questions using databases. I also practiced turning query results into insights and visuals.
